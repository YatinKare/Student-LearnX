# LearnX

>[!WARNING]
> CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT:
> Alpha-Stage. <br>
> <br>Current State: Developing open source PowerPoint to HTML [library](https://github.com/YatinKare/pptx2html_json) for backend service. 

Have you ever wanted a way to study content, but haven't been able to remember what your presentor exactly said? LearnX is a great solution.

## Description

This app turns PowerPoint review into a interactive experience that will improve memory recall drastically and allows people to listen / read exactly what the presentor said during specific points during the presentation. 

## Features
> Here are some of the features that are coming:

1. **Recording and Transcribing presentations for later use.**
2. **Importing presentations that will be transformed within an interactive environment, allowing people to listen back to specific sections of the lecture.**
3. **...And many more :)**

Thanks for supporting my early development!

## Development
Run `./start.sh` after cloning. 
>[!note]
> This is still in prototyping, many of the basic features are still in development. </br>
> Please be careful altering code.
